# JSON has become today's machine-readable output format (on Unix)

JSON's ubiquity makes it the good enough solution that we can all settle on. When handling machine readable output we should only use JSON, it works well enough already with existing tooling and anything new should only bother meeting this standard.

In general, JSON provides a clear and basically unambiguous way to represent text data and much numeric data, even if it has relatively strange characters in it (ie, JSON has escaping rules that everyone knows and all tools can deal with); it's also generally extensible to add additional data without causing heartburn in tools that are dealing with older versions of a program's output. And on Unix there's an increasingly rich collection of tools to deal with and process JSON.
